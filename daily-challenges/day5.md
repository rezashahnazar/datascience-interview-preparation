**Day 5: End-to-End Capstone + Mock Interview (Extended)**

Below is the final day's roadmap, focusing on pulling together everything you've practiced. You'll undertake a comprehensive capstone-style project, then simulate a real interview environment where you present and defend your work. The goal is to test your ability to articulate concepts, field live questions, and demonstrate practical, end-to-end problem-solving skills in data science.

---

## 1. Capstone-Style Challenge

### Goal

Work on a holistic, realistic scenario that integrates data engineering, classical ML, deep learning insights, and business context—tying everything together in a final project.

### Scenario

• You have an e-commerce dataset of user interactions (clicks, queries, purchases) plus product metadata (title, description, category).  
• Your task: build a simple semantic search system for this store.

### Steps & Prompts

1. **Data Ingestion & Cleaning**

   - Outline how you'd load this data from a real environment (CSV, database export, or a streaming pipeline).
   - Identify missing or inconsistent product descriptions. Figure out a strategy to clean or standardize them.

2. **Feature Engineering**

   - Combine product title, description, and category into a single text field for embedding.
   - Optionally, incorporate user signals: how often an item is clicked, added to cart, or purchased.

3. **Modeling Approach**

   - Choose (or fine-tune) a pre-trained embedding model (e.g., Sentence-BERT) for each product.
   - For a given query (e.g., "red running shoes"), compute an embedding and compare to your product embeddings via cosine similarity (or another metric).

4. **Evaluation**

   - Manually compile a small set of test queries with "ground truth" products.
   - Measure Retrieval Metrics such as:  
     • Recall@K: Did we retrieve the relevant product within our top-K results?  
     • MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) or NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) to measure ranking quality.

5. **Deployment & Updates**
   - Draft an architecture for serving these embeddings in a real system:  
     • A vector store or specialized index for quick approximate nearest neighbor search.  
     • Strategies for caching popular queries.  
     • Plan for daily or weekly updates (new products, updated embeddings).

### Questions to Answer

- How do you choose the similarity metric? Why might cosine similarity be standard for embeddings?
- How do user interactions (clicks, purchases) feed back into your ranking?
- What's your approach if you have to handle millions of products? (Vector indexing solutions, approximate search, incremental training.)

### 1.1 Capstone Project: Building a Semantic Search System

**EXPLORATION**

**Challenge:** Implementing a Semantic Search System for E-commerce Products

**Objective:** Develop a semantic search system that retrieves relevant products based on user queries by leveraging embeddings and similarity metrics.

**Approach:**

1. **Data Ingestion & Cleaning:**

   - **Loading Data:**

     - **Method:** We'll use pandas to load the dataset from CSV files.
     - **Considerations:** Ensure that the CSV files are properly formatted and handle any encoding issues.

   - **Identifying Missing Values:**

     - **Implementation:**

       ```python:data_cleaning/load_and_clean.py
       import pandas as pd

       def load_data(file_path):
           df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
           print("Initial Data Shape:", df.shape)
           return df

       def identify_missing(df):
           missing = df.isnull().sum()
           print("Missing Values:\n", missing)
           return missing

       def clean_data(df):
           # Example: Fill missing descriptions with 'No description available'
           df['description'].fillna('No description available', inplace=True)
           # Drop rows with critical missing values
           df.dropna(subset=['title', 'category'], inplace=True)
           return df

       if __name__ == "__main__":
           df = load_data('data/products.csv')
           missing = identify_missing(df)
           df = clean_data(df)
           print("Data Shape after Cleaning:", df.shape)
           df.to_csv('data/cleaned_products.csv', index=False)
       ```

     - **Explanation:**
       - Load the dataset and display its shape.
       - Identify and print missing values per column.
       - Fill missing descriptions with a placeholder and drop rows missing essential fields like 'title' and 'category'.
       - Save the cleaned dataset for further processing.

2. **Feature Engineering:**

   - **Combining Text Fields:**

     - **Implementation:**

       ```python:feature_engineering/feature_engineer.py
       import pandas as pd

       def combine_text_fields(df):
           df['combined_text'] = df['title'] + ' ' + df['description'] + ' ' + df['category']
           return df

       if __name__ == "__main__":
           df = pd.read_csv('data/cleaned_products.csv')
           df = combine_text_fields(df)
           df.to_csv('data/feature_engineered_products.csv', index=False)
           print("Combined text fields into 'combined_text'")
       ```

     - **Explanation:**
       - Combine 'title', 'description', and 'category' into a new field 'combined_text' to create a single text representation of each product.

   - **Incorporating User Signals:**

     - **Implementation:**

       ```python:user_signals/user_signals.py
       import pandas as pd

       def incorporate_user_signals(df):
           df['interest_score'] = df['clicks'] * 1 + df['add_to_cart'] * 3 + df['purchases'] * 5
           return df

       if __name__ == "__main__":
           df = pd.read_csv('data/feature_engineered_products.csv')
           df = incorporate_user_signals(df)
           df.to_csv('data/user_signals_products.csv', index=False)
           print("Incorporated user signals into 'interest_score'")
       ```

     - **Explanation:**
       - Create an 'interest_score' that weights clicks, add-to-cart actions, and purchases to reflect user interest in each product.

3. **Modeling Approach:**

   - **Selecting and Fine-Tuning SBERT:**

     - **Implementation:**

       ```python:semantic_search/sbert_embedding.py
       from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
       import pandas as pd
       import pickle

       def load_data(file_path):
           df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
           return df

       def generate_embeddings(df, model_name='all-MiniLM-L6-v2'):
           model = SentenceTransformer(model_name)
           embeddings = model.encode(df['combined_text'].tolist(), convert_to_tensor=False)
           return embeddings

       def save_embeddings(embeddings, file_path='data/product_embeddings.pkl'):
           with open(file_path, 'wb') as f:
               pickle.dump(embeddings, f)
           print(f"Embeddings saved to {file_path}")

       if __name__ == "__main__":
           df = load_data('data/user_signals_products.csv')
           embeddings = generate_embeddings(df)
           save_embeddings(embeddings)
       ```

     - **Explanation:**
       - Load the feature-engineered dataset.
       - Use Sentence-BERT to generate embeddings for the 'combined_text' of each product.
       - Save the embeddings for efficient retrieval.

4. **Semantic Search Implementation:**

   - **Computing Similarity and Retrieving Products:**

     - **Implementation:**

       ```python:semantic_search/semantic_search.py
       from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
       from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
       import pandas as pd
       import pickle
       import numpy as np

       def load_data(file_path):
           df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
           return df

       def load_embeddings(file_path='data/product_embeddings.pkl'):
           with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
               embeddings = pickle.load(f)
           return embeddings

       def get_query_embedding(query, model):
           return model.encode([query], convert_to_tensor=False)

       def search(query, df, embeddings, model, top_k=5):
           query_emb = get_query_embedding(query, model)
           similarities = cosine_similarity([query_emb], embeddings)[0]
           top_indices = np.argsort(similarities)[::-1][:top_k]
           top_products = df.iloc[top_indices]
           top_similarities = similarities[top_indices]
           return top_products, top_similarities

       if __name__ == "__main__":
           df = load_data('data/user_signals_products.csv')
           embeddings = load_embeddings()
           model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
           query = "Red running shoes for men"
           top_products, top_scores = search(query, df, embeddings, model)
           print("Top Products:")
           print(top_products[['title', 'category', 'interest_score']])
           print("Similarity Scores:", top_scores)
       ```

     - **Explanation:**
       - Load the product data and precomputed embeddings.
       - Embed the user query and compute cosine similarity with all product embeddings.
       - Retrieve and display the top-K most similar products based on similarity scores.

5. **Evaluation:**

   - **Creating Test Queries and Measuring Metrics:**

     - **Implementation:**

       ```python:evaluation/evaluate_semantic_search.py
       from sklearn.metrics import recall_score, average_precision_score
       import pandas as pd
       from semantic_search.semantic_search import search, load_data, load_embeddings, SentenceTransformer

       def evaluate_search(test_queries, df, embeddings, model):
           recalls = []
           average_precisions = []
           for query, ground_truth in test_queries.items():
               top_products, top_scores = search(query, df, embeddings, model)
               retrieved = top_products['product_id'].tolist()
               relevant = ground_truth
               recall = recall_score([pid in retrieved for pid in ground_truth], [1]*len(retrieved), average='macro')
               average_precision = average_precision_score([pid in retrieved for pid in ground_truth], top_scores)
               recalls.append(recall)
               average_precisions.append(average_precision)
           avg_recall = sum(recalls) / len(recalls)
           avg_ap = sum(average_precisions) / len(average_precisions)
           print(f"Average Recall@K: {avg_recall}")
           print(f"Average Precision@K: {avg_ap}")

       if __name__ == "__main__":
           test_queries = {
               "Red running shoes for men": [101, 202],
               "Wireless headphones noise cancelling": [303, 404],
               "Organic cotton t-shirts": [505, 606],
           }
           df = load_data('data/user_signals_products.csv')
           embeddings = load_embeddings()
           model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
           evaluate_search(test_queries, df, embeddings, model)
       ```

     - **Explanation:**
       - Define a set of test queries with corresponding ground truth product IDs.
       - For each query, perform the semantic search and calculate Recall@K and Average Precision@K.
       - Compute and display the average metrics across all test queries.

## 2. Mock Interview Simulation

### Goal

Recreate the pressure and structure of a real interview. You'll present your capstone project, handle interruptions, solve a quick data structure or algorithm puzzle, and reflect on your performance.

### Structure

1. **Part A: Present Your Capstone (5–10 minutes)**

   - Summarize your approach from data ingestion to final evaluation.
   - Emphasize your design decisions (embedding models, similarity metrics, caching, etc.).
   - Anticipate potential questions:  
     • "Why did you pick that embedding model?"  
     • "Could we do a simpler solution with TF-IDF?"  
     • "How do we handle synonyms and brand names that the embeddings might not capture?"

2. **Part B: Technical Interruptions**

   - Be ready for real-time "what if" scenarios:  
     • "Our system must handle brand-specific misspellings—does your approach still work?"  
     • "What's the time complexity of finding the top-k similar products in an embedding space of input size N?"  
     • "Can you scale to 1 million queries/day? How?"

3. **Part C: Data Structure / Algorithm Puzzle**

   - The interviewer might ask you to revisit a Day 1 style coding challenge.
   - For instance, "Implement a function to detect a cycle in a linked list" or "Write a quick BFS to find the shortest path in a graph."
   - Demonstrate clarity by walking through your logic, time complexity, and edge cases—just like you did in Day 1 exercises.

4. **Part D: Reflection**
   - Evaluate your performance:  
     • Did you justify your design decisions clearly?  
     • How did you handle unexpected technical questions?  
     • Could you have communicated your solutions more concisely or used diagrams/visual aids?

---

## 3. Final Q&A Drills (Rapid-Fire)

### Goal

Ensure you have crisp, confident answers to fundamental ML, data engineering, and deep learning questions. This is often how interviews end—quick checks on breadth of knowledge.

#### ML Fundamentals

1. Explain the bias-variance tradeoff in your own words.
2. Why does overfitting happen, and how do you detect it?

#### Data Engineering

1. When might you pick NoSQL over a relational DB?
2. How would you optimize Spark jobs (partitioning, caching, etc.)?

#### Neural Network Practicalities

1. Why might training loss go down while validation loss plateaus?
2. What are vanishing gradients, and how do we mitigate them (e.g., ReLU, residual connections)?

#### E-Commerce Context

1. How would you measure the effectiveness of a newly deployed semantic search feature?
2. How do you handle real-time vs. batch updates for product embeddings?
