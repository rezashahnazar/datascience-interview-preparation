**Day 2: Classical Machine Learning & Statistical Foundations (Extended)**

Below is an expanded set of questions, challenges, and prompts for Day 2, tailored to reinforce your understanding of essential machine learning concepts. By the end of the day, you should be comfortable discussing everything from basic EDA to tree-based models, with a solid grasp on how to evaluate models using various metrics.

---

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Goal

Learn how to explore, visualize, and gain insights from a dataset before modeling. This sets the stage for better feature engineering and understanding data nuances.

### Challenges & Prompts

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Identify missing values in a dataset (e.g., Iris, Titanic, or your own CSV).
   - Compare strategies: dropping vs. imputing with mean/median or domain-specific values.
   - Check for outliers and decide whether to remove or cap them.
2. **Descriptive Statistics & Correlation**
   - Calculate mean, median, standard deviation, and percentiles for numerical fields.
   - Visualize relationships (scatter plots, pair plots, correlation heatmaps).
   - Note any strong correlations or suspicious anomalies (e.g., perfect correlation or negative correlation).
3. **Distributions & Visualization**
   - Plot histograms, box plots, violin plots.
   - Identify skew in distributions and think about transformations (log, sqrt) if needed.

### Questions to Answer

- What strategy do you use for missing data in a dataset with 30% of values missing in a single column?
- How do outliers affect mean and standard deviation?
- How would you handle highly skewed variables in a regression model?

## 2. Regression & Classification Basics

### Goal

Refresh the core concepts of linear vs. logistic regression, along with classification metrics that interviewers often focus on.

### Challenges & Prompts

1. **Logistic Regression from (Near) Scratch**
   - Conceptualize the gradient descent steps for a simple binary classification problem.
   - Compare manual gradient checking vs. library outputs (e.g., scikit-learn).
   - Integrate regularization (L1/L2) and observe how it impacts coefficients.
2. **Metrics & Model Evaluation**
   - Manually compute precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and ROC-AUC.
   - For a given confusion matrix, show how each metric changes if you tweak the decision threshold.
   - Use k-fold cross-validation to see metric variance.
3. **Bias-Variance Intuition**
   - Explore how an overly complex model (e.g., high-degree polynomial regression) might overfit.
   - Notice changes in training error vs. validation error.

### Questions to Answer

- How does logistic regression differ from linear regression on a conceptual level?
- Why might you choose F1-score over accuracy in an imbalanced classification problem?
- When is a high recall more important than a high precision (and vice versa)?
- Can you explain the difference between using a validation set vs. a test set?

## 3. Tree-Based Models

### Goal

Understand decision trees and random forests—often asked about in interviews due to their interpretability and good baseline performance.

### Challenges & Prompts

1. **Basic Decision Tree**
   - Train and compare performance with logistic regression on a small dataset.
   - Investigate parameters like max_depth, min_samples_split, or criterion (entropy vs. Gini).
2. **Random Forest**
   - Assess how bagging (bootstrap aggregation) helps reduce variance.
   - Compare results with a single decision tree.
3. **Interpretability & Overfitting**
   - Notice if your decision tree overfits, especially with few training examples.
   - Check feature importances in both decision trees and random forests.

### Questions to Answer

- Why do decision trees overfit if they are grown too deep?
- What’s the importance of random feature selection in a random forest?
- How do ensemble methods (like random forests) address the bias-variance tradeoff?

## 4. (Optional) Basic Statistical Concepts

### Goal

Review core statistics to handle typical ML or data-related interview questions.

### Quick Quiz

1. **p-Value**
   - Define it in simple terms.
   - Understand how it’s used (and sometimes misused) in hypothesis testing.
2. **Type I & Type II Errors**
   - Relate them to false positives and false negatives.
   - Note which scenario is more critical in health-related or financial contexts.
3. **Confidence Intervals**
   - Describe how they’re constructed.
   - Differentiate between confidence intervals and prediction intervals.

### Questions to Answer

- How does the concept of confidence intervals tie into model uncertainty?
- Why might you choose a 95% confidence interval vs. 99%?
- In an A/B testing scenario, how do Type I and Type II errors manifest?

## 5. Connecting It Back to E-Commerce (Optional Brainstorm)

You’re preparing for a data science role in e-commerce, so it helps to tie these Day 2 concepts to business scenarios:

1. **Product Classification**
   - Imagine using logistic regression or a tree-based model to classify products into categories based on text descriptions.
   - What metrics would be key (F1-score if categories are imbalanced)?
2. **Predicting Customer Churn**
   - A regression or classification approach could answer retention questions.
   - Think about how you’d combine EDA and modeling to identify which features are most correlated with churn.
3. **Decision Tree for Promotions**
   - Who should receive a discount or coupon? A tree-based model could segment users by purchase frequency, cart size, etc.

## Day 2 Action Items Recap

By the end of Day 2, you should:

1. Have walked through several EDA steps on a small dataset, taking notes on key insights.
2. Implemented (or at least outlined) logistic regression and computed classical classification metrics—both by hand (conceptually) and by referencing library methods.
3. Explored tree-based models (decision trees, random forests), noting how they compare to simpler methods in terms of overfitting and interpretability.
4. Brushed up on foundational statistical concepts (p-value, errors, confidence intervals).

Keep all your notes organized. In the next steps (Day 3 and beyond), you’ll build on these foundations for more advanced ML techniques—like deep learning and larger-scale data engineering tasks.

> **Next Steps (Preview for Day 3):**  
> You’ll jump into neural networks, covering everything from forward/backprop to CNNs or RNNs/Transformers. Stay focused on the fundamentals you revisited here—understanding data, preprocessing, and metrics will remain crucial when you move into deep learning scenarios.

Good luck with Day 2—this will set you up nicely to discuss both theoretical and practical aspects of classical machine learning in your upcoming interviews!
