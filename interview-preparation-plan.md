# **How to Use This 5-Day Plan Effectively**

1. **Hands-On First**: Write actual code for the daily challenges. Don’t just outline solutions—implement them in Python (e.g., using scikit-learn, PyTorch, or TensorFlow).
2. **Document Your Steps**: Keep a **notebook** or text file where you log your reasoning, complexities, metrics, and any interesting trade-offs.
3. **Explain Out Loud**: Each day, try to verbally explain your solutions as if you’re in an interview. This helps build clarity and confidence.
4. **Review & Iterate**: Revisit tricky parts (especially Day 1 data structures or Day 2 metrics) as they often reappear in final interviews.
5. **Day 5 = Simulation**: Treat Day 5 seriously. Present your capstone project, handle interruptions, do a quick data structure puzzle, and reflect on potential improvements.

By following these daily challenges and reflecting on the provided questions, you’ll reinforce **both** your coding proficiency and your ability to discuss solutions at a senior level—covering topics from data structures to neural networks, from classical ML metrics to distributed data engineering, and from semantic search to NLP chatbots.

**Good luck**, and remember that clear, structured thinking combined with practical implementation skills is exactly what interviewers look for. You’ve got this!
