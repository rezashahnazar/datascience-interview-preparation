## Overview

Embark on a focused journey through essential Data Science topics, progressing from foundational concepts to advanced applications tailored for real-world scenarios. Here's what each day covers:

1. **[Day 1: Data Structures & Algorithms Refresher](./day1)**  
   Strengthen your core computer science fundamentals, tackle coding challenges, and master complexity analysis.

2. **[Day 2: Classical Machine Learning & Statistical Foundations](./day2)**  
   Dive deep into Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), regression & classification basics, and tree-based models.

3. **[Day 3: Deep Learning Fundamentals](./day3)**  
   Refresh your understanding of neural networks, from forward/backpropagation to common architectures like CNNs and RNNs.

4. **[Day 4: Advanced Topics – Semantic Search, Chatbots, and Big Data](./day4)**  
   Explore practical, domain-specific areas essential for e-commerce, including semantic search systems, NLP-based chatbots, and large-scale data processing.

5. **[Day 5: End-to-End Capstone + Mock Interview](./day5)**  
   Consolidate your learning with an end-to-end project and simulate a real interview environment to present and defend your work.

## Usage Guide

### 1. **Start with Day 1**

Begin your preparation by immersing yourself in Day 1's content. Ensure you understand the challenges and work through the exercises to build a solid foundation.

### 2. **Progress Sequentially**

Follow the plan day by day:

- **Day 1:** Data Structures & Algorithms
- **Day 2:** Classical Machine Learning
- **Day 3:** Deep Learning
- **Day 4:** Advanced Topics
- **Day 5:** Capstone Project & Mock Interview

### 3. **Engage with Challenges**

Each day contains specific tasks and questions designed to test your knowledge and problem-solving abilities. Implement the provided code snippets, experiment with variations, and ensure you understand the underlying concepts.

### 4. **Document Your Progress**

Maintain a notebook or digital document to log your reasoning, code implementations, and insights. This practice will aid in retention and provide valuable references during interviews.

### 5. **Prepare for Day 5**

As you approach Day 5, focus on integrating all the skills you've acquired. Develop a capstone project that demonstrates your ability to handle real-world Data Science problems, and practice presenting your solutions clearly and confidently.

## Best Practices

- **Hands-On Implementation:**  
  Don't just read through the material—actively implement the solutions in Python using libraries like scikit-learn, PyTorch, or TensorFlow.

- **Explain Out Loud:**  
  Practice explaining your solutions as if you're in an interview. This helps build clarity and confidence.

- **Review & Iterate:**  
  Regularly revisit and refine your solutions based on feedback and new insights.

- **Connect to Real-World Scenarios:**  
  Relate each challenge to practical applications, especially within e-commerce, to showcase your ability to apply theoretical knowledge effectively.
