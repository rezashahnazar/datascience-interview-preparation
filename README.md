## Overview

1. **Interview Preparation Plan**  
   Start by reading through the main 5-day interview preparation plan, which outlines the key focus areas for each day and provides high-level guidance on how to approach the challenges.  
   • [interview-preparation-plan.md](./interview-preparation-plan.md)

2. **Daily Challenges**  
   Each day has a dedicated file with a deeper breakdown of tasks, questions, and optional brainstorming exercises. Work through them in order for a cohesive learning experience:

   • [Day 1: Data Structures & Algorithms Refresher](./daily-challenges/day1.md)  
   • [Day 2: Classical Machine Learning & Statistical Foundations](./daily-challenges/day2.md)  
   • [Day 3: Deep Learning Fundamentals](./daily-challenges/day3.md)  
   • [Day 4: Advanced Topics – Semantic Search, Chatbots, and Big Data](./daily-challenges/day4.md)  
   • [Day 5: End-to-End Capstone + Mock Interview](./daily-challenges/day5.md)

## Usage Guide

1. **Read the Plan:**  
   Begin with the “Interview Preparation Plan” to understand the overall structure. It highlights the focus of each day—from fundamentals (Day 1) to advanced ML and big data concepts (Day 4), culminating in a mock interview and final capstone (Day 5).

2. **Dive into Daily Challenges:**  
   For each day, open the corresponding markdown file under “daily-challenges” to see hands-on tasks, conceptual questions, and real-world e-commerce scenarios. Tackle them in the suggested sequence.

3. **Take Notes & Document:**  
   As you solve the challenges, keep notes of your reasoning, complexities, code snippets, and findings. This will help you review and articulate your solutions clearly.

4. **Simulate an Interview:**  
   On Day 5, you’ll integrate your learnings into a capstone project and practice presenting your approach and reasoning, just as you would in a real interview session.

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Day 1 (DS & Algorithms):**  
   • Warm up with coding exercises on arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and practice BFS/DFS.  
   • Ensure you’re comfortable with complexity analysis.

2. **Day 2 (Classical ML):**  
   • Explore EDA, regression, and classification tasks.  
   • Refresh decision trees, random forests, and key metrics (precision, recall, F1, etc.).

3. **Day 3 (Deep Learning):**  
   • Build simple neural networks, dig into CNNs and/or NLP transformer models.  
   • Practice hyperparameter tuning and regularization strategies.

4. **Day 4 (Advanced Topics):**  
   • Dive into semantic search, chatbots, and big data pipelines.  
   • Learn how to scale and deploy these solutions in a production-like environment.

5. **Day 5 (Capstone & Mock Interview):**  
   • Combine everything into an end-to-end project.  
   • Present your solutions, handle on-the-spot data structure puzzles, and polish your interview demeanor.

## Next Steps

1. **Open the interview-preparation-plan.md**  
   Read the high-level strategy and goals for each day.

2. **Proceed Day by Day**  
   Start with [Day 1](./daily-challenges/day1.md) to lay your foundation. Then follow the plan sequentially through Day 5.

3. **Stay Organized**  
   Keep track of challenges completed and concepts learned. Review them frequently to reinforce retention.

4. **Prepare for the Real Interview**  
   Treat Day 5’s “mock interview” scenario seriously—practice articulating solutions, justifying trade-offs, and showcasing your strengths.

Best of luck on your interview journey!
